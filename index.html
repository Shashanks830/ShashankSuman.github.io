												<h4>In-situ measurement of Optical Micro/nano fibers</h4>
												<p> There are diffrent ways to characterise the delicate optical nanofibers. The characterisation
													is essential to optimize and explore its uses. In this project, a nondestructive method is 
													employed across various sizes of these fibers. It addresses the issues like simplicity, reusability, 
													risk-free and costeffectiveness which were not addressed as whole in earlier proposed methods.

												<h4>Time Crystals</h4>
												<p>Time crystals are a fascinating concept in condensed matter physics. They represent a quantum system of 
													particles whose lowest-energy state is one in which the particles are in repetitive motion. In regular 
													crystals, atoms are arranged periodically in space. However, in a time crystal, atoms are arranged 
													periodically in both space and time. Time crystals are a unique phase of matter that exhibit periodic 
													behavior in time, providing a fascinating area of study in the field of quantum physics.
													During the project various aspects of these crystals were studied.

												<h4>Fabrication and Analysis of Tapered Optical Micro/nanofibers</h4>
												<p>Optical Micro/nano fibers has proven to be a vital tool for various quantum technologies.
													A cost effective fabrication technique using strong acid was adapted. The prepared samples 
													were characterised and compared against their counterparts favricated using more sophisticated 
													techniques like heat and pull. The power of propogating modes inside the fiber was studied.
													A technique was proposed for experimental studies citing the results of the simulations obtained.
													Preeliminary experiments were conducted to test the test the ambiguities due to experiments.

												<h4>Introduction to Quantum error correcting codes</h4>
												<p>Quantum error correction codes are designed to protect 
													quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. 
													These codes work by spreading the information contained in a quantum bit (qubit) 
													across a larger system of qubits. By doing so, they enable the detection and 
													correction of errors without disturbing the information. The project focussed 
													mainly on basics of quantum information and error correction code.
